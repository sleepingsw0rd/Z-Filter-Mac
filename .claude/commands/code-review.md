# Code Review

Use the code-reviewer agent to conduct a comprehensive review of all recent code changes. The agent will examine the code for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, performance problems, testing coverage, and compatibility concerns.

The code-reviewer agent will provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples and prioritize critical issues that could affect security, functionality, or maintainability.

**Output**: Review report will be saved to `.claude/ai/review-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

## Steps to follow:

1. **Gather metadata for the review report:**
   - Gather relevant metadata from git (commit hash, branch name, repository name, timestamps)
   - Filename: `.claude/ai/review-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
     - Format: `review-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` where:
       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
       - description is a brief kebab-case description
     - Examples:
       - `review-2025-10-03-feature-implementation.md`
       - `review-2025-10-03-bug-fixes.md`

2. **Use the code-reviewer agent with metadata:**
   - Pass the metadata to the code-reviewer agent for structured report generation
   - The agent will examine code for security vulnerabilities, quality issues, performance problems, testing coverage, and compatibility concerns
   - Agent will generate a review report with proper frontmatter and metadata

3. **Review report structure:**
   - The agent will create a comprehensive report with metadata followed by content:

4. **Save and present review completion:**
   - Save the review report to `.claude/ai/review-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
   - Present a concise summary of the review findings to the user
   - Include the path to the generated review report
   - Highlight any critical issues that require immediate attention

The code-reviewer agent will provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples and prioritize critical issues that could affect security, functionality, or maintainability.

## Important Notes:

- Always run fresh git analysis - the review should reflect the current state of changes
- The review report should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Include temporal context (when the review was conducted) via metadata
- Focus on finding concrete security issues, quality problems, and maintainability concerns
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Ensure all metadata fields are properly populated using git commands
